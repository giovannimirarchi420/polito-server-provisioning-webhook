# Server Provisioning Webhook

A Python FastAPI webhook service for handling server provisioning events. This service manages Kubernetes BareMetalHost resources without network configuration.

This webhook has been developed to serve events produced by the [Cloud Resource Reservation System](https://github.com/giovannimirarchi420/cloud-resource-reservation), a comprehensive platform for managing cloud resource reservations with authentication, monitoring, and multi-service orchestration.

## Overview

This webhook receives server reservation events and provisions/deprovisions BareMetalHost resources in a Kubernetes cluster using the MetalÂ³ operator.

## Features

- **Server Provisioning**: Automatically provisions BareMetalHost resources
- **Server Deprovisioning**: Handles resource cleanup and deprovisioning
- **Security**: HMAC signature verification for webhook security
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and comprehensive logging
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Native Kubernetes API integration

## Key Differences from Original

This service is focused only on server provisioning and does **NOT** include:
- Network switch configuration
- VLAN management
- Port assignment
